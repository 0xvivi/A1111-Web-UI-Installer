# INSTALLING

## **`‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è`**

- This only Works on Windows 10 and 11
- This has only been tested on **NVIDIA Graphics Cards** ([**Make sure you're up to date**](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)
)
- **This installer is not affiliated with the original [Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)** repository, if you get errors after clicking **`LAUNCH WEBUI`**, they'll be related to the WebUI itself and not this installer, so do not report them here, but [**here**](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/new/choose)
- On the other hand, if you find a glitch before that or have a feature request, please [**fill an issue**](https://github.com/EmpireMediaScience/A1111-Web-UI-Installer/issues) and more importantly **join [the new Automatic1111's SD WebUI discord](https://discord.gg/xU8y74HG4d) to discuss the project and get general help about the WebUI**
 > ‚ö†Ô∏è This installer will always clone the latest bleeding edge update of the WebUI. Some Updates can break it

5. **Select where you want to install the WebUI**
   >Default is fine but if you want to install things somewhere else, it is highly recommended to do it in a dedicated empty folder, else it's going to be pretty messy
7. **The checkboxes:**
   1.  [x] **Clean Install** : Keep it checked if this is your first install via this Auto Installer. Uncheck it if you only want to update the Launcher and keep your existing WebUI intact (with your settings/models/extensions etc.)
         >**Note** (experimented users only): It ***may*** be possible to add the Launcher to an existing WebUI folder that you had manually git cloned (without this installer), as long as you move the WebUI folder into a subfolder, and chose said subfolder as the Install Path during the install. **But I haven't tested it and it could result in some random stuff**
   1.  [x] **Install SD Checkpoint** : Select it if you don't have already have a Checkpoints/Models folder
         >‚ö†Ô∏è if you have no idea what this means, leave the box checked
   2.   [x] **I Understand** : Read the "Important Details" and check it if you understand
8. Click <kbd>Install</kbd> and **remember, this can take a while**
9.  Once installed, a folder will open with a shortcut called ***A1111 WebUI (Pin to Taskbar)***
10. You can drag & drop it on your taskbar if you wish, this is the launcher for the WebUI
11. Launch the shortcut to open the **[Custom Launcher](#the-launcher)**
12. Once you've selected what you wanted, click **`LAUNCH WEBUI`**, this will launch a CMD window, logging what it's doing 
      >‚ö†Ô∏è**Be patient** this will take a while at first, when it's ready, it will open the webUI in your browser
13. When you're done using the WebUI, close the browser tab & close the CMD window

- [x] **Auto-Update Extensions** : Same thing but with the extensions
- [x] **Clear Generated Images** : This will clear all previously generated images from the outputs folder at launch, to give you a blank slate for this session.
